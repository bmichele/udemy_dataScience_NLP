# Spam detection project

## Takeaways
Are you going to explain Naive Bayes and Adam Boost?
Nope! That's in the ML review section.
The point is that all ML algos are the same, we counld change to other models by changing just one line.
We must know we are doing classification, so we need to know which classes are classifier.
Also, we can test different classifyiers in order to assess which is the best one

Central message: apply ML to NLP problems
So, do not worry too much about the algos, but more about the application of ML.
At this level, we do not care about how decision tree works, but how to use a decision tree

### One level down - ML theory
Usefull to implement algos with numpy, scipy, ...
These packages are optimized for fast algebra, so these are not efficient if we want to focus on applications.

### Another level down - Hardware
GPU vs CPU vs TPU...

Takeaways: discussions of this lower-level topics are not necessary to understand the code used for spam detection
