# Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python


## Why this repo?
This repositories is a collection of code snippets and notes I have taken attending the online course [Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-natural-language-processing-in-python/) on [udemy](www.udemy.com), by Lazy Programmer Inc.

Material of the course is available on their repo at https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples

__Disclaimer #1__
The code in this repo has been entirely written by me, taking inspiration from the lectures and, from time to time, from the implementations provided in the course repository. As such, you should not assume that everything will work out of the box!

__Disclaimer #2__
Following the advice of the lecturer, I am trying to code as many things as possible in order to understand how the things work. Of course, better implementations of the algorithms can be found in libraries. For example, my implementation of the vectorizer functions to get feature vectors out of lists of words will never compete with the NLTK implementation!
